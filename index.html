      Hey there!
      You aren't suppose to see this! Anywho... since you are already here...
      if (employer) {
        Yes, I'm always looking for great opportunities! 😀
      }
      else if (female && single) {
        Ping me up on Instagram saying "Let's grab a pizza" 🙈
      }
      else if (geek) {
        Hi, I love to be friends with like minded people. Since you found this you already have my respect! Message me on LinkedIn, maybe we could help each other. 😄
      }
      else {
        goto: th3c0d3br34ker.github.io/404 😶
      }
